NavCoin is open-source; its design is public, nobody owns or controls NavCoin and everyone can take part.

The Developer Guide aims to provide the information you need to understand NavCoin and start building Navcoin-based applications, but it is not a specification. To make the best use of this documentation, you may want to install the current version of Navcoin Core, either from source or from a pre-compiled executable.

Questions about Navcoin development are best asked in one of the Navcoin development communities. Errors or suggestions related to documentation on Navcoin.org can be submitted as an issue or posted to the NavCoin mailing list.

In the following documentation, some strings have been shortened or wrapped: “[…]” indicates extra data was removed, and lines ending in a single backslash “\” are continued below. If you hover your mouse over a paragraph, cross-reference links will be shown in blue. If you hover over a cross-reference link, a brief definition of the term will be displayed in a tooltip.
